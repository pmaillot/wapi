Following the remarks from a Github user, this repository no longer contains the wapi library for not strictly complying to GPL licensing, and it became easier for me to just move it to another website. The wapi library and accompagnying demo/test programs can now be found as **free download** on a personal website at **https://x32ram.com/wapi**, and the documentation for the API (and more) can be doanloaded from **https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-iptgd2Uxw4qPEbmegG2Sqccf8AbRRfk/view?usp=drive_link**
You can find plenty of pre-compiled utilities at **https://sites.google.com/site/patrickmaillot/wing**, and you are welcome to ask for C source code for them (the free utilities) if this can be of help.
